# Financial Manager Application

> Application created for the purpose of studying and practicing software development using Python/Django on the backend and React/Typescript on the frontend.
> NOTE: For the full operation of the application, the frontend and backend must be running SIMULTANEOUSLY.

This is the main README of the project. Here you will find information about the project, such as how to set up and run the application.

The project is divided into 3 main folders:

- docs: contains information about the project requirements as well as a data mockup.
- server: contains the API code.
- frontend: contains the frontend code.

All subfolders have their own READMEs with specific information!
